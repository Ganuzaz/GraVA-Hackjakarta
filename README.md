Digital Empowerment Challenge
# Empowering Merchants Through Virtual Assistance

### Abstract
Currently, Grab has expanded its sales channels for food merchants, focusing on growth and scaling within specific channels. However, to better support merchants, Grab needs to establish a presence across all sales channels and ensure a consistent experience throughout. The DAFBA team has developed a solution to address these challenges.

The solution is based on Virtual Assistance with Gen AI backend. Furthermore, it uses NLP with machine learning model, fundamental meaning, knowledge graph and ranking and resolver engine.

### Project Description
The Dafba team proposes a solution to empower Grab's food merchants by integrating virtual assistance to provide consistent experiences across all sales channels. The solution leverages social media marketing, SEO, online listings, and email marketing to enhance merchant visibility both inside and outside the Grab ecosystem. Virtual assistance standardizes interactions, automates tasks, handles high volumes of requests, and supports personalization, ensuring uniform customer experiences. By joining the Grab ecosystem, merchants can utilize targeted marketing campaigns and promotional tools, while virtual assistance offers scalable, localized support, acting as an abstraction layer on top of Grab's functionalities to boost growth and customerÂ recognition.
